# Hi there.
Hi, I'm **squish**, but you can call me Riley. I do da web developerererererirengining

Currently learning Typescript (cause I love suffering)!

I know:
- Laravel (kind of)
- PHP (mostly but I can't answer spontaneous questions lol)
- HTML (easy as)
- CSS (slightly harder but still easy)
- JS (why does this exist)
- Three.js (i hate it)
- Node.js (barely)
- Typescript (like 0.0001%)

# Websites I run:
- https://www.squish-town.xyz - Squish Town - the FREE online physics playground!
- https://querysquish.com - a free, trackerless search engine for all.

# Stuff I use:
- Visual Studio Code
- PHP-CS for formatting or whatever it's called
- Copilot for autocompletions and autocorrect since im lazy
- Either Arch Linux or a random Debian distro, I have a few old computers laying around.
